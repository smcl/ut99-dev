# UT99-dev

This is a collection of things I've played around with in UnrealScript for UT99.

## Usage

(TBC)

## TODO

- add build instructions and/or scripts to each 
- (maybe?) add build scripts at top-level
- make exploding kamikaze bot
- explore HUD Mutators (render simple Game of Life?)
- experiment with Pawn.DrawScale
- I saw "nalicow" model in UnrealShare I think, can we have that little guy running around?
